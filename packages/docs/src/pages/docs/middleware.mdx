# Middleware

Sometimes you may want to customize the behaviour of BlinkDB when methods like `insert`, `update`, `remove`, or others are called.
Perhaps you want to prevent all calls to `remove` (and instead soft delete records), or you'd like to log all actions taken, or
you just simply want to intercept all calls to a certain function.

This is all quite simple with a call to [`use()`](/docs/reference/use):

```ts
use(userTable, async (ctx) => {
  // Log the method called
  console.log(ctx.action);
  // Log parameters given to the method
  console.log(ctx.params);

  // Call the native implementation
  const result = await ctx.next(...ctx.params);
  return result;
})
```

More info about how hooks work and what you can do with them can be found in [the reference](/docs/reference/use).
