# Filters

BlinkDB has a powerful query system, and can filter, sort & limit your data.

```ts
const userTable = createTable<User>(db, 'users')();

const users = await many(userTable, {
  where: {
    age: gt(16),
    name: in('Alice', 'Bob'),
    todoCount: between(0, 10)
  },
  sort: {
    key: 'age',
    order: 'asc'
  }
});
```

When you call `many()`, `one()`, `first()`, or `watch()`, you can supply
a query in order to tell BlinkDB what items you want to receive & how you want
to receive them.

The properties you can supply in the query are always the same:

```ts
export type Filter<T, P extends keyof T> = {
  where?: Where<T> | Or<T> | And<T>;
  sort?: Sort<T>;
  limit?: Limit<T, P>;
};
```

With `where`, you specify what items to receive, `sort` specifies how
items are to be sorted, and `limit` tells BlinkDB how many items
you want.

## Where

With where, you can specify if you want to load an entity from the
database based on their properties. The simplest case is equality
checking - with the following query, you can load all users from
the database who are 16 years old and called `Alice`:

```ts
// Retrieves all users called Alice who are 16 years old
const users = await many(userTable, {
  where: {
    age: 16,
    name: 'Alice'
  }
});
```

If you're matching based on equality, you can also use a so called
"matcher" - which is just a function to make the above look a little bit
prettier:

```ts
// Retrieves all users called Alice who are 16 years old
const users = await many(userTable, {
  where: {
    age: eq(16),
    name: eq('Alice')
  }
});
```

But don't worry! Equality checking is not the only matcher available,
there are many more below.

### `in(...)`

`in(...)` matches all entities where the set property is one of the
supplied values.

```ts
// Match all users called Alice, Bob, or Vance
const users = await many(userTable, {
  where: {
    name: in('Alice', 'Bob', 'Vance')
  }
});
```

### `gt(...)`

`gt(...)` matches all entities where the set property is greater than
the supplied value (either a string, number, or Date).

```ts
// Match all users older than 43yrs
const users = await many(userTable, {
  where: {
    age: gt(43)
  }
});
```

### `gte(...)`

`gte(...)` matches all entities where the set property is equal to
or greater than the supplied value (either a string, number, or Date).

```ts
// Match all users who are 87yrs old or older
const users = await many(userTable, {
  where: {
    age: gte(87)
  }
});
```

### `lt(...)`

`lt(...)` matches all entities where the set property is less than
the supplied value (either a string, number, or Date).

```ts
// Match all users younger than 20yrs
const users = await many(userTable, {
  where: {
    age: lt(20)
  }
});
```

### `lte(...)`

`lte(...)` matches all entities where the set property is equal to
or less than the supplied value (either a string, number, or Date).

```ts
// Match all users who are 31yrs old or younger
const users = await many(userTable, {
  where: {
    age: lte(31)
  }
});
```

### `between(...)`

`between(...)` matches all entities where the set property is between
the first supplied value (inclusive) and the second supplied value (inclusive).
The property to check against can be of type string, number, or Date.

```ts
// Match all users who are between 40yrs and 50yrs old
const users = await many(userTable, {
  where: {
    age: between(40, 50)
  }
});
```

### `contains(...)`

`contains(...)` matches all entities where the set array property
includes the given value.

```ts
interface Users {
  nicknames: string[];
}

// Match all users who have 'Big Nick' as a nickname
const users = await many(userTable, {
  where: {
    nicknames: contains('Big Nick')
  }
});
```

### `and(...)`

`and(...)` matches all entities which match all
of the supplied matchers.

```ts
// Match all users called Alice who are 26yrs old
const users = await many(userTable, {
  where: and([
    {
      age: 26
    },
    {
      name: 'Alice'
    }
  ])
});
```

The above query can also be written without `and(...)`, like this:

```ts
// Match all users called Alice who are 26yrs old
const users = await many(userTable, {
  where: {
    age: 26,
    name: 'Alice'
  }
});
```

### `or(...)`

`or(...)` matches all entities which match at least one
of the supplied matchers.

```ts
// Match all users who are either younger than 40yrs
// or older than 50yrs
const users = await many(userTable, {
  where: or([
    {
      age: lt(40)
    },
    {
      age: gt(50)
    }
  ])
});
```
