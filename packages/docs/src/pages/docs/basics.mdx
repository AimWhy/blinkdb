# Basics

Once you've installed blinkDB (using `npm install blinkdb`), you can create your own database.

```ts
import { createDB } from 'blinkdb';

const db = createDB();
```

Similar to a relational database, entities are stored in Tables in blinkDB.
You can create them with `createTable(db, <name>)()` (be sure to call the function twice).
Each table contains entities of a certain type.

```ts
import { createDB, createTable } from 'blinkdb';

interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  age?: number;
}

const db = createDB();
const table = createTable<User>(db, "users")();
```

ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations - it's that simple! You can now create, query, update, and delete items.
