# Observing changes

If you're using a frontend framework like [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/),
it's a bad idea to query the database everytime you want to render its items in your components.
Your component might rerender multiple times a second, and while BlinkDB makes queries
very fast, there is a better alternative.

`watch()` will observe a table and call the provided callback every time an item is inserted, updated, or deleted
(The callback will also be called once after calling `watch(...)` with all items in the table).

```ts
const watcher = watch(userTable, users => {
  console.log('All users', users);
});
```

Only retrieving certain items from the table is also possible - just provide the [filter](/docs/filter) to `watch(...)`,
and your callback will only be called if items matching the filter are inserted/updated/deleted.

```ts
const watcher = watch(userTable, { where: { age: { $lt: 3 } } }, babies => {
  console.log('All babies: ', babies);
});
```

If you want to stop receiving updates, call the `.close()` function on the object returned from `watch()`.

```ts
watcher.close();
```
