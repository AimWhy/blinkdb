# watch()

`watch()` observes changes in the table.
Whenever an entity is inserted, updated, or deleted, blinkDB calls the provided callback
with all table entities.

```ts
const userTable = createTable<User>(db, "users")();
watch(userTable, users => {
  console.log('All users: ', users);
});
```

`watch()` is much, much faster than manually retrieving items everytime you insert, update, or remove. It's perfect for
usage inside reactive components like React Hooks.

A [filter](/docs/filters) can also be specified, which causes `watch()` to only call the function
if an inserted / updated / deleted entity matches, and only entities which match the filter
are provided as arguments.

```ts
const userTable = createTable<User>(db, "users")();
watch(userTable, { where: { age: lt(3) } }, babies => {
  console.log('All babies: ', babies);
});
```
