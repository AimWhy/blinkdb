# one()

Retrieves one entity from the table.

This is similar to `first()` in the sense that it retrieves only the first entity matching the given [filter](/docs/filters), but:

- it throws an exception if no entity was found
- it throws an exception if more than 1 entity matched the filter

This makes it perfect for retrieving entities by their primary id, which are unique by default.

```ts
const aliceId = "alice-user-uuid";
const alice = await one(userTable, {
  where: {
    id: aliceId,
  },
});
```

| Parameter | Description                                                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `table`   | The table created by [`createTable()`](/docs/reference/createTable) .  |
| `filter`  | The item returned will match the filter. See [filters](/docs/filters). |
