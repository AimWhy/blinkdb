# one()

Retrieves an entity from the table.

This is similar to `one()` in the sense that it retrieves only the first entity matching the given [filter](/docs/filters), but:

- it throws an exception if no entity was found
- it throws an exception if more than 1 entity matched the filter

This makes it perfect for retrieving entities by their primary id, which are unique by default.

```ts
const userTable = createTable<User>(db, "users")();

const aliceId = 'alice-user-uuid';
const alice = await one(userTable, {
  where: {
    id: aliceId
  }
});
```
