# first()

Retrieves the first entity from the table.

If a [filter](/docs/filters) is supplied, "first" means the first item that would be returned
from a similar call to `many()` .

```ts
const userTable = createTable<User>(db, "users")();

const oldestUser = await first(userTable, {
  sort: {
    key: "age",
    order: "desc"
  }
});
```
