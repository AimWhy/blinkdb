# createTable()

Creates a new table where entities can be inserted/updated/deleted/retrieved.

```ts
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  age?: number;
}

const db = createDB();
const userTable = createTable<User>(db, "users")();
```

| Option    | Description                                                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `primary` | The primary key of the entity. See [Primary Keys](#primary-keys) |
| `indexes` | Fields of the entity on which an index should be created. See [Indexes](#indexes) |

## Primary keys

BlinkDB automatically assumes that the primary key of a table is `id` , if not otherwise supplied:

```ts
interface Task {
  uuid: string;
  name?: string;
  description?: string;
}

const userTable = createTable<Task>(db, "tasks")({
  primary: "uuid"
});
```

## Indexes

Indexes are a valuable type performance improvement for databases by reducing the amount of items scanned per query.
To use them effectively, specify properties here that are often used in filters when you call `first()` / `one()` / `many()` / `watch()` -
This will increase speed drastically, with only a small performance hit on writes.

```ts
interface User {
  id: string;
  // Email will be used often in filters, better create an index
  email: string;
  // No need for an index on Age - itwon't be specified much in filters
  age: number;
}

const userTable = createTable<Task>(db, "tasks")({
  primary: "uuid",
  indexes: ["email"]
});
```
