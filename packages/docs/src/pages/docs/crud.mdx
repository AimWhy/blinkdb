# CRUD

Just like any other database, BlinkDB gives you the ability to **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate and **D**elete
items in a table.

- You can add entities to the table (with `insert()` ),
- query entities within it (with `first()`, `many()` & `one()` ),
- update database entities (with `update()` ),
- and delete them (with `remove()` ).

## Creating entities

In order to query your table, first you need to put entities inside it.
You can do so with `insert()`:

```ts
import { createDB, createTable, insert } from 'blinkdb';

const db = createDB();
const userTable = createTable<User>(db, "users")();
await insert(userTable, { id: 'some-uuid', name: 'Alice', age: 24 });
```

Typescript automatically makes sure that you are using the correct properties, and that you don't forget
about the required ones.

### Generating an UUID

If your entities are using strings as primary keys, you're probably hoping to use UUIDs - universally unique
identifiers. BlinkDB automatically supplies you with a `uuid()`, blazing fast method for generating them.

```ts
await insert(userTable, { id: uuid(), name: 'Bob', age: 21 });
```

## Querying entities

Now that you have items in your table, it's time to retrieve them! Of course, you can always
retrieve all items from a table with `many()`:

```ts
const users = await many(userTable);
```

But where BlinkDB really starts to shine is when you're using filters. Most of the time,
you won't need all entities in your app, just a specific subset - and BlinkDB allows you to filter
your results, optimizing for speed along the way.

For example, you can retrieve the first ten users older than 26 like this:

```ts
const usersOlderThan26 = await many(userTable, {
  where: {
    age: gt(26)
  },
  limit: { take: 10 }
});
```

BlinkDB allows you to filter, sort, and limit items - see more on [Filters](/docs/filters).

### Retrieving one entity

In case you only need the first item of a query result, you can use `find()`.

```ts
const youngestUser = await find(userTable, {
  sort: {
    key: 'age',
    order: 'asc'
  }
});
```

On the other hand, if you're sure the query you're using will only ever return one item,
you can use `one()` - It will throw an exception if there isn't exactly one entity matching the filter.

```ts
const alice = await one(userTable, {
  where: {
    id: 'alice-uuid'
  }
});
```

## Updating entities

To update entities, simply call `update()`, and provide the primary key the entity as well as any changes you'd like
to make.

```ts
const userTable = createTable<User>(db, "users")();
const userId = await insert(userTable, { id: uuid(), name: 'Alice', age: 15 });
// Increase the age of Alice
await update(userTable, { id: userId, age: 16 });
```

<hr />

## Deleting entities

You can delete entities by calling `remove()` with the primary key of the entity to be deleted.

```ts
const userTable = createTable<User>(db, "users")();
const userId = await insert(userTable, { id: uuid(), name: 'Alice', age: 15 });
// Remove Alice from the table
await remove(userTable, { id: userId });
```
