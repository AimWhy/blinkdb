BlinkDB is **not production ready yet**. Proceed with caution,
and head on over to the "[Future plans](/docs/future)" page to see
what awaits BlinkDB in the future.
</div>

The easiest way to get started with BlinkDB is to install it in your project with Yarn:

```bash
yarn add blinkdb
```

If you prefer NPM, you can instead use

```bash
npm i blinkdb
```
