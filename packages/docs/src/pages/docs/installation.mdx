# Installation

<div class="border border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-100 rounded-md px-4 py-3 [&>*]:!m-0">
BlinkDB is **not production ready yet**. Proceed with caution,
and head on over to the "[Future plans](/docs/future)" page to see
what awaits BlinkDB in the future.
</div>

The easiest way to get started with BlinkDB is to install it in your project with Yarn:

```bash
yarn add blinkdb
```

If you prefer NPM, you can instead use

```bash
npm i blinkdb
```

## Configure TS

While it isn't strictly necessary, in order to ensure complete type safety,
set the following fields in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  ... ,
  "compilerOptions": {
    ... ,
    // Enables `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    // Prevents you from updating entity fields with `undefined`
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true
  },
}
```
